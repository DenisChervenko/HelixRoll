This project was also focused on the speed of its creation, but for some military and political reasons,
I did not have the opportunity to work on it

-Back to this project-

It was easy for me to create a pool of objects, in principle I don’t see anything
complicated, but there is one problem, this is the repetition of objects, 
I just don’t know how to solve this problem, so for each repetition of an object, 
I decided to create another object, interaction with which will slow down a bit time

Looking through the code, I basically did not see anything that could affect performance, 
perhaps this is due to the simplicity of the code, or because of my inexperience
